Thanks for trying

                Radia 3D Magnetostatics Software

====================================
CONFIGURATION REQUIRED

To use Radia for Igor Pro, you should have one of the following configurations:

- PC running Windows 9x/NT4/2000/XP with (at least) 64 M of memory and a license of Igor Pro 3.1x/4.x.

====================================
PREVIOUS VERSION SHOULD BE DE-INSTALLED

Before making any steps for installation of the new version, make sure that the previous version of Radia for Igor Pro is completely de-installed from your system. This means that: 

Any aliases (shortcuts) of files and folders (or the files and folders itself) which have "RADIA" or "Radia" in their names, should be removed from the following folders of your Igor Pro installation:
"Igor Pro Folder"
"Igor Pro Folder:Igor Extensions"
"Igor Pro Folder:Igor Help Files"
"Igor Pro Folder:Igor Procedures"

====================================
INSTALLATION ON A PC UNDER WINDOWS 9x/NT4/2000/XP

1. Download the self-extracting SRW distribution executable file for Windows from the ESRF Insertion Devices Web site (http://www.esrf.fr/machine/support/ids/Public/index.html).

2. Quit Igor Pro, if it is running.

3. Run the self-extracting executable file. The installation utility will ask you to specify / confirm the location of Igor Pro, and will try to perform necessary actions for proper installation (i.e. create SRW folder inside the Igor Pro folder and create shortcuts to Radia files in Igor Pro sub-folders).

4. Start Igor Pro. At the first start after the SRW installation, Igor may show a dialog box suggesting to compile the help file "Radia Help.ifn". Choose to compile it. Finally, you should obtain new menu item(s) named "Radia..." in the Igor menu.

INSTALLATION ON A POWER MACINTOSH

(to come soon)

====================================
GETTING STARTED

The first thing we recommend to do after the installation is to start Igor Pro and select "Radia->Help" in the menu Igor Pro.

After this, one can try examples (accessible via menu "Radia").
