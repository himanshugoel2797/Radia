      Thank you for downloading the Radia magnetostatics software !

**************************************************************************

The following notes relate to the Radia for Mathematica 9/10 for Windows/Linux/MacOSX 64 bit.

This version of Radia requires:

- Mathematica 9.0 or later for Windows (7/8) / Linux / MacOSX 64 bit;
- Web Browser - to read HTML files of the Radia documentation.

**************************************************************************

!!! IMPORTANT !!!
To be able to work with Radia, please do the following:

1) Make sure that the Radia package, in particular Radia.exe, init.m, RadiaTopics.nb and RadiaButtons.nb files are located in the ".../AddOns/Applications/Radia" folder of your Mathematica installation.
If the Radia package is located in any other place on your hard disk, copy all the Radia folder (with sub-folders) to ".../AddOns/Applications" of the Mathematica installation.

2) Try examples distributed with the Radia package. Run the Mathematica Front-End. Open the "Example#1.nb" file in the "...\Examples" of the Radia folder. Read instructions in the notebook and try to execute the input cell there. If it behaves as described in the instructions, this means that you have successfully installed Radia. Try the examples #2 - #7.

**************************************************************************

It is assumed that, before starting to seriously work with Radia, you have already got some experience of using the Mathematica. If not, please spend some time on that.

Use Web Browser to read the Radia documentation. Start by loading the "...Radia/RadiaDoc/RadiaTitle.html" file and then browse through the documentation structure. The information on the primary Radia functions can be found in the Reference Guide. The documentation is also accessible through the Web.

Have fun! Let us know your comments, if any.
