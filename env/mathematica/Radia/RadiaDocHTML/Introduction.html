		<P>
			<FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1">The Radia software package was designed for solving 
				physical and technical problems one encounters during the development of 
				Insertion Devices for Synchrotron Light Sources. However, it can also be used 
				in different branches of physics, where efficient solution of 3D boundary 
				problems of Magnetostatics is needed. </FONT>
		<P>
			<FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1">The Radia package is essentially a 3D 
				magnetostatics computer code optimized for Undulators and Wigglers. In the 
				Radia very special attention is paid to the accurate and fast computation of 
				the magnetic field and the field integrals along a line. </FONT>
		<P>
			<FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1">Radia can solve a variety of problems with linear 
				and nonlinear, isotropic and anisotropic magnetic materials (such as iron and 
				permanent magnets, respectively) and, of course, with current-carrying elements 
				of different shapes.</FONT>
		<P>
			<FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1">The code has been extensively benchmarked with 
				respect to a commercial finite element code. All ESRF Insertion Devices built 
				since 1992 have been designed using this code or its earlier versions. A large 
				number of predictions made by Radia concerning the magnetic field and field 
				integrals were verified on real insertion devices after manufacture. We are 
				therefore convinced that by an efficient use of Radia one can design nearly any 
				permanent magnet undulator or wiggler ab-initio, including the central field as 
				well as the extremities. </FONT>

			<FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1">The method used in Radia belongs to the category of 
				Volume Integral Methods and differs strongly from the Finite Element Methods 
				(FEM). Volume objects are created, material properties are applied to these 
				objects. Each object can be subdivided into a number of smaller objects for 
				which one tries to solve for the general problem in terms of the magnetization. 
				The solution is performed by building a large matrix in memory which represents 
				mutual interactions between the objects. We call this an Interaction Matrix. 
				The final magnetization in each small object is obtained iteratively, by a 
				sequence of multiplications of the Interaction Matrix by instant magnetizations 
				vector, taking into account the material properties.&nbsp;We call this a 
				Relaxation procedure. In this approach, one applies some kind of segmentation 
				to the field-producing objects (typically iron) but, contrary to the FEM 
				approach, one does not need to mesh the vacuum. This has a number of important 
				consequences:</FONT>

					<FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1">Geometries opened to infinity are more easily 
						simulated.</FONT>
					<P></P>
				<LI>
					<FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1">The number of elements required for a given 
						precision on the prediction of the central field of an undulator is typically 
						20 times smaller in our approach than with a FEM code. The CPU time required is 
						also typically 20 times smaller. For example, the peak field of a hybrid 
						undulator can be obtained with a precision better than 1% in less than 10 
						seconds on a PowerMac 4400, while it would take a few minutes with a FEM code. </FONT>
					<P></P>
				<LI>
					<FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1">Once the Relaxation is done, the magnetic field and 
						field integrals can be computed anywhere in space whatever the distance to the 
						field-producing objects.</FONT>
					<P></P>
				<LI>
					<FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1">Field integrals can be computed using analytical 
						formulas. This might be one of the most significant advantages of the Radia 
						over a FEM code. The precision on a field integral computed with Radia only 
						depends on the level of segmentation of the iron but not on the field sampling 
						and boundary conditions at infinity as it is the case with FEM codes. It is 
						easy to refine the segmentation until the computed field integrals are stable. 
						In other words, accurate predictions of the magnetic field integrals are 
						possible with Radia (eventhough it may require a large segmentation of the iron 
						), which are practically impossible with FEM codes.</FONT>
					<P></P>
				<LI>
					<FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1">The geometry creation is much simpler. In fact, a 
						hybrid undulator can be created and solved using no more than 20 lines of 
						Mathematica code. </FONT>
					<P></P>
				<LI>
					<FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1">The essential drawback of Radia compared to a FEM 
						code is the fast divergence of memory required for a given number of elements. 
						In the present version of Radia, the memory required scales proportionally to 
						the square of the number of elements. For example, one roughly needs 50 (13) MB 
						of memory to solve a geometry made of 1000 (500) elements (which roughly 
						corresponds to 20000 elements in a FEM code for a similar precision on the 
						field). We plan to improve Radia in this respect in future versions. However, 
						with the present version, for example,&nbsp;we have solved and optimized 
						various geometries for the central field and field integral of a heavily 
						saturated high field permanent magnet wiggler (2 T) using less than 3M of 
						memory for the Radia code. </FONT>
					<P></P>
				<LI>
					<FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1">Another drawback of Radia is an "artificial" 
						discontinuity in computation of magnetic field inside the subdivided iron 
						objects, occurring on the boundary between any adjacent sub-objects. This is 
						also planned to be improved in future versions. The drawback&nbsp;is harmless 
						with respect to the field computed outside the iron.</FONT></LI>

				and 2D field plots are performed using the Graphics facilities built in
